# MME-audio-watermarking
The codes for A Lattice-Based Embedding Method for Reversible Audio Watermarking(doi: 10.1109/TDSC.2023.3314612)
Considering the smooth usage on our codes, please follow **these steps**:
1) Since our audio database is larger than 25Mb that the files can not upload on Github, please first run **add_pathfile.m** to create database cover_data.mat.
2) After doing step 1), you can run **AWGN_Test.m** and **MP3_Test.m** to get the Fig. 14 in this paper.
3) If you want to finish other simulations aided by MME watermarking, the codes you needed are contained in this folder.
